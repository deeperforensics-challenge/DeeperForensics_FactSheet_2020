This fact sheet template\footnote{We acknowledge the nice fact sheet template provided by the Wider Challenge.} is meant to structure the description of the contributions made by each participating team in the DeeperForensics Challenge 2020. 
%
Ideally, all the aspects enumerated below should be addressed. The authenticity of the provided information and the achieved performance on the ``test-final'' data will be used to decide the awardees of the DeeperForensics Challenge 2020. The fact sheet will not be published. There is no page limit for the fact sheet.
%
After the final results are decided, the main winners will be invited to submit a more detailed paper of their method and the used data, i.e., technical report.
